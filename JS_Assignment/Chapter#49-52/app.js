// 1. Create a signup form and display form data in your web
// page on submission.

// function submit_(){
//     fname = document.getElementById("fname").value;
//     lname = document.getElementById("lname").value;
//     email = document.getElementById("email").value;
//     pwd = document.getElementById("pwd").value;
//     document.write("<h1> SIGN-UP INFO </h1>")
//     document.write("<h2>First Name :</h2> ",fname,"<br/>");
//     document.write("<h2>Last Name : </h2>",lname,"<br/>");
//     document.write("<h2>Email :</h2> ",email,"<br/>");
//     document.write("<h2>Password </h2>",pwd,"<br/>");
// }





// 2. Suppose in your webpage there is content area in which
// you have entered your item details, but user can only see
// some details on first look. When user clicks on “Read
// more” button, full detail of that particular item will be
// displayed.

// function expand(){
//     var para = "<br/>Yes, all the information is right there in the book if the author has done a good job. But learning a language entails far more than reading some information.<br/> You need to commit the information to memory, which requires some kind of plan. You need to practice. How are you going to structure that?<br/> And you need some way to correct yourself when you go off-course. Since a book isn't the best way to help you with these tasks, most authors don't even try.<br/> Which means all the work of designing a learning path for yourself is left to you. And this do-it yourself meta-learning,<br/> this struggle with the question of how to master what the book is telling you, takes more effort than the learning itself."
//     var toadd = document.getElementById("show");
//     toadd.innerHTML += para;
// ;}
